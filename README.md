##WH3Music
A simple Flask web app designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi. It's goal is to allow users to upload music to the Pi and use the Pi to play music directly.

####It currently includes:
*Collaborative playlist management with socket.io.
*A simple jax-based song uploading interface. (more metadata coming soon)
*A next song button.
*A small built-in music library, including 4'33" by John Cage and several other masterpieces.

Future commits will bring:
*The ability to actually play music
*Documentation!
