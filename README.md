A simple Flask web app designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi. It's goal is to allow users to upload music to the Pi and use the Pi to play music directly.

####It currently includes
* Collaborative playlist management with socket.io.
* A simple ajax-based song uploading interface. (more metadata coming soon)
* A simple, partially functional music player
* A small built-in music library, including 4'33" by John Cage and several other masterpieces.

####Future commits will bring
* Better control of the music
* A real way to browse the library
* Documentation!
