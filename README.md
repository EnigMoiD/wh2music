##WH3Music
A simple Flask web app designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi. It's goal is to allow users to upload music to the Pi and play that music through a web interface.

####It currently includes
* Collaborative playlist management.
* A simple ajax-based song uploading interface.
* A simple but still buggy music player
* A small built-in music library, including 4'33" by John Cage.

####Future commits will bring
* Better control over the music (volume, equilizer, etc.)
* Better upload experience (progress bar and typeahead on albums and artists)
* Real browsing by artist or album, not just search.
* Documentation.
