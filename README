A simple Flask web app designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi. It's goal is to allow users to upload music to the Pi and use the Pi to play music directly.

It currently includes:
Collaborative playlist management with socket.io! (Currently reductive...)
A nice, ajax-based song uploading interface! (more metadata coming soon!)
A next song button!
A small built-in music library, including 4'33" by John Cage and many other masterpieces.

Future commits will bring:
The ability to add songs to the playlist!
The ability to actually play music!
Documentation!
